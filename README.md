Visualizing the Titanic dataset in Power BI involves creating interactive and insightful dashboards to explore passenger demographics, survival rates, and other key trends.

Key Visualizations:
Survival Analysis:

Bar chart: Show counts of survivors vs. non-survivors.
Pie chart: Display survival rate percentages.
Demographics:

Clustered bar chart: Compare survival by gender.
Histogram: Analyze age distribution of passengers.
Class and Survival:

Stacked bar chart: Display survival rates across passenger classes.
Scatter plot: Explore fare vs. survival by class.
Embarkation Points:

Map visualization: Show passenger distribution by embarkation locations (e.g., Cherbourg, Queenstown, Southampton).
Interactive Filters:

Add slicers for filtering by gender, class, and embarkation point to uncover detailed insights.
Using Power BIâ€™s interactivity, you can dynamically explore relationships within the Titanic dataset to identify patterns and trends effectively.
